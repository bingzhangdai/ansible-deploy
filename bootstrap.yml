      ## reason for ignore_errors: yes
      ## "version_compare" was replaced with "version" starting ansible 2.5;
      ## CentOS/RHEL 7.x use ansible 2.4, so not able to grasp what version_compare is.
      ## Ansible 2.9 removes the version_compare and does not recognize it any longer.
      ## As our need is to add python2 only on versions before 2.8, if this fails
      ## (due to missing version_compare command), we are fine.
      ## We do not cover cases where it fails due to other reasons, but that is a reasonable risk,
      ## and that issue will be captured later in the flow.
